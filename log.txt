log friday 6/30/17:
I successfully got detectnet-camera working. I did the following:
1) edit detectnet-camera.cpp with the functions that I want
2) create a header file that our program links to (I made a copy and put it in ./util/)
3) in jetson-inference/build: run 'cmake ..' and 'make'
4) copy the libjetson-inference.so file from ~/jetson-inference/build/aarch/lib/ to ./lib
5) edit the CMakeLists.txt file in ~/jetson-inference and add the flag -fPIC
6) go to jetson-inference/build/detectnet-camera/CMakeFile/detectnet-camera.dir/
7) run: g++ -shared -o libdetectnet-camera.so detectnet-camera.cpp.o
8) cp the resulting so file to ./lib
9) make sure Makefile includes this new library

next, we need to include the cuda library files (/usr/local/cuda/lib64) to our makefile:
1) LIBDIRS     += -Llib -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64
2) LDFLAGS     = $(LIBDIRS) -ldetectnet-camera -ljetson-inference -lcudart -lzgb -ldxl_sbc_cpp
